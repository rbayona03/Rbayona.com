This code is the base to my portfolio website.

I wanted to create something i could be proud of as my first portfolio site.
i did alot of research going into this this with what direction i could go.
and wanted to take the route of freelance meets somewhat contemp with unique positions
that arent usually found in grid or flex layouts. as well as color and font schemes that represent my take on 
street wear.
